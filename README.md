#### Following the requirements:

    1. You should create a backend on NodeJs, you should create at least 2 endpoints to load questions and save answers;
    2. Your data should come from a MySQL database;
    3. The endpoints should be tested;

3.	Creation of components on frontend;
4.	Code reusability;
5.	Code organization and structures;
